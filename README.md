# projectQuotes
This project is created for practice purposes. 
User is initially presented with a random quote, and can get a new random quote or share the existing one on Twitter by pressing the appropriate button.
Demo: https://projectquotes-48b15.web.app/

The goal of this project was to learn and practice DOM manipulation, along with getting the data from API instead of using hardcoded data.
When user clicks 'New quote' button they get a random quote which can be posted on Twitter by clicking 'tweet' button, which will open a new tab and redirect the user to the appropriate Twitter page.

While new quote is being randomly chosen from fetched data, the loading spinner is being shown to the user.
